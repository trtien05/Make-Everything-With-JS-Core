   - Provide navigation controls for users to switch between pages.
4. **Sort Products**
   - Allow users to sort products based on various criteria:
     - **Default**: The initial sorting order.
     - **Price low to high**: Products are sorted from the lowest to the highest price.
     - **Price high to low**: Products are sorted from the highest to the lowest price.
     - **Most discounted**: Products are sorted based on the highest discount percentage.
